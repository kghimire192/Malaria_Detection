## Malaria_Detection

### Project Overview
Detection of different stages of malaria from blood cells images, leveraging deep learning tools (Convolutional Neural Network and PyTorch framework). The goal is to use a Neural Network to tell all the types of cells that are present in each image, that is, this is a Multi-Label classification problem.

### Dataset
